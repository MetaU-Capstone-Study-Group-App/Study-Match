## Overview
Although studying in groups can have immense benefits, college students often struggle to form study groups with students in the same classes as them or with the same academic goals. Study Match aims to solve this problem. By placing students in study groups based on availability, class schedule, and compatibility, Study Match will help students learn in a collaborative and efficient way.
